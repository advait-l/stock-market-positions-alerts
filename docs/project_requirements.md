# Project Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Stock Market Positions Alerts system. The system will provide near real-time alerts to users based on market data, news sentiment, and technical analysis indicators for the **Indian stock market**.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Data Ingestion

- The system must ingest real-time stock market data from a provider that supports Indian markets, such as **Upstox** or **TrueData**.
- The system must ingest news articles and press releases from various sources with a focus on Indian markets, such as **The Hindu Business Line** and **Moneycontrol**.
- All data must be stored in a time-series database for historical analysis.

### 2.2. Technical Analysis

- The system will use the `bamboo-ta` library to calculate a range of technical indicators, including but not limited to:
  - Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
  - Bollinger Bands

### 2.3. News Analysis

- The system will perform sentiment analysis on news articles to gauge market sentiment for specific stocks.
- The system will identify keywords and entities in news articles to determine their relevance to specific stocks.

### 2.4. Alerting System

- The system will generate alerts based on a combination of technical indicators and news sentiment.
- Users can create custom alert rules based on their preferred stocks and indicators.
- Alerts will be delivered to users via email and SMS.

### 2.5. User Interface

- A web-based user interface will be developed to allow users to:
  - Manage their portfolio of stocks.
  - Configure alert rules.
  - View historical data and alerts.

### 2.6. Frontend Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js will be used as the React framework for its capabilities in Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG), which will provide good performance and SEO.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS will be used for styling, providing a utility-first approach for rapid UI development.
- **Component Library**: A headless UI library like `shadcn/ui` will be used on top of Tailwind CSS for building accessible and reusable components.
- **State Management**: Zustand will be used for lightweight and simple global state management.
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (formerly React Query) will be used for managing server state, caching, and data fetching.
- **Deployment**: The application will be deployed on Vercel for seamless integration with the Next.js framework.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Performance

- The system must be able to process real-time data with low latency.
- The alert generation process must be completed within seconds of a triggering event.

### 3.2. Reliability

- The system must be highly available, with a target uptime of 99.9%.
- The system will include error handling and logging to ensure that any issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

### 3.3. Scalability

- The system must be designed to handle a growing number of users and stocks.
- The architecture will be modular to allow for easy scaling of individual components.

### 3.4. Security

- User data and API keys must be stored securely.
- The system will be protected against common web application vulnerabilities.
