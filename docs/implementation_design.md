# Implementation Design

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the implementation design for the Stock Market Positions Alerts system. It outlines the project structure, development workflow, and testing strategy to be followed throughout the development process.

## 2. Project Structure

The project will be organized into the following directories:

- `docs/`: Contains all project documentation.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the application.
  - `backend/`: Contains the Python source code for the backend services.
  - `frontend/`: Contains the React source code for the frontend application.
- `tests/`: Contains all unit and integration tests.

## 3. Development Workflow

The development workflow will follow a GitFlow model, with the following branches:

- `main`: The main branch, which will always contain the latest stable release.
- `develop`: The development branch, which will be used to integrate new features.
- `feature/*`: Feature branches, which will be used to develop new features.
- `bugfix/*`: Bugfix branches, which will be used to fix bugs in the main branch.
- `hotfix/*`: Hotfix branches, which will be used to fix critical bugs in the main branch.

## 4. Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will consist of the following:

- **Unit Tests:** Each backend service and frontend component will have its own set of unit tests.
- **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will be used to test the interactions between the different components of the system.
- **End-to-End Tests:** End-to-end tests will be used to test the complete workflow of the application, from the user's perspective.

## 5. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

A CI/CD pipeline will be set up using GitHub Actions to automate the testing and deployment process. The pipeline will be triggered on every push to the `develop` and `main` branches.

## 6. Project Management

The project will be managed using a Kanban board in GitHub Projects. This will allow the team to track the progress of tasks and identify any bottlenecks in the development process.
