# Technology Stack

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technology stack for the Stock Market Positions Alerts system. The chosen technologies are selected to meet the functional and non-functional requirements of the project, with a focus on performance, scalability, and ease of development.

## 2. Backend

- **Language:** Python 3.9
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Rationale:** Python is a versatile language with a rich ecosystem of libraries for data science, machine learning, and web development. FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework that is easy to learn and use.

## 3. Frontend

- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Component Library:** shadcn/ui
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Data Fetching:** TanStack Query
- **Rationale:** The frontend stack is built on Next.js, a powerful React framework, with TypeScript for type safety. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS for rapid development, complemented by shadcn/ui for accessible components. Zustand provides simple state management, while TanStack Query manages server-side data fetching and caching.

## 4. Database

- **Type:** Time-Series Database
- **Technology:** InfluxDB
- **Rationale:** A time-series database is optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data, which is ideal for our use case. InfluxDB is a popular and highly performant open-source time-series database.

## 5. Data Processing

- **Library:** Pandas
- **Technical Analysis:** bamboo-ta
- **Rationale:** Pandas is the de-facto standard for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The bamboo-ta library provides a comprehensive set of technical analysis indicators that can be easily integrated into our data processing pipeline.

## 6. Deployment

- **Frontend:** Vercel
- **Backend:** Docker, Kubernetes on AWS
- **Rationale:** The frontend will be deployed on Vercel for its seamless integration with Next.js. The backend services will be containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes on AWS for scalability and reliability.
