# Technical Specifications

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed technical specification for the Stock Market Positions Alerts system. It builds upon the project requirements and technology stack documents to provide a clear blueprint for the development of the system.

- **Data Processing Service:** Responsible for cleaning, transforming, and enriching the raw data.
- **Technical Analysis Service:** Responsible for calculating technical indicators using the `bamboo-ta` library.
- **News Analysis Service:** Responsible for performing sentiment analysis on news articles.
- **Alerting Service:** Responsible for generating and sending alerts to users.
- **API Server:** Responsible for providing a RESTful API for the frontend to interact with.
- **Frontend:** A web-based user interface built with React.

## 5. Workflow

1. The Data Ingestion Service collects real-time data from **Upstox** or **TrueData** and news sources.
2. The raw data is sent to the Data Processing Service, where it is cleaned and transformed.
3. The cleaned data is then sent to the Technical Analysis Service and the News Analysis Service.
4. The Technical Analysis Service calculates a range of technical indicators and stores the results in InfluxDB.
5. The News Analysis Service performs sentiment analysis on the news articles and stores the results in InfluxDB.
6. The Alerting Service continuously monitors the data in InfluxDB and generates alerts when the user-defined rules are met.
7. The alerts are sent to the user via email and SMS.
8. The user can view the alerts and historical data in the frontend.
