Before implementing any new feature, always update the relevant documents in the `docs/` folder to reflect the changes. This includes:

- [docs/project_requirements.md](mdc:docs/project_requirements.md)
- [docs/tech_stack.md](mdc:docs/tech_stack.md)
- [docs/technical_specs.md](mdc:docs/technical_specs.md)
- [docs/implementation_design.md](mdc:docs/implementation_design.md)

This ensures that the project documentation is always up-to-date with the latest changes.
